**DATA** 
The data contains 600 songs from 2010-2019.
Each song is represented by 10 different features: BPM, Energy, Danceability, Loudness, Liveness, Valence, Length, Acousticness, Speechiness, Popularity.

**Project** 

The project is based on the article "DJ-MC: A Reinforcement-Learning Agent for Music Playlist Recommendation" 
which deals the following problam : how to recommend the next song to the customer?
the reaserchers are modeling the process of desicion as a markovian chain and using reinforcement learning in order to find an optimized solution. 

**implementation**
On this project you'll find an implementation of the described algorithm of DJ-MC and a greedy algorithm in order to compare both and check if DJ-MC get better result than the greedy algorithm.
